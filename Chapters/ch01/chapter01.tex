\subsection{The Positive Integers and The Sucessor numbers} % TODO: figure out the latter part
The set of positive integers, $\mathbb{N}^*$, is defined as satisfying the following conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item For any aribitrary positive integer $a$, its successor, $a^+$ is a positive integer as well.
	\item There exists a positive integer such that no positive integer's successor is that integer. Notate this as $1$.
	\item Except for $1$, every positive integer is the successor of a positive integer.
\end{enumerate}
